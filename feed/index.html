										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The City of Syracuse took another step in it&#8217;s open data evolution recently by launching an <a href="http://data.syrgov.net/">open data portal</a>, joining the City of Albany in the small but growing fraternity of Upstate cities with open data portal.</p>
<p>The new open data portal represents months of work by the city&#8217;s Chief Data Officer and <a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/datacuse">municipal innovation team</a>. There are a number of very useful and valuable data sets available on the site, particularly the newly released parcel data file with details on all 40,000+ properties in the city.</p>
<p>The launch of this site underscores Syracuse&#8217;s commitment to transparency and engagement, but it also shows that open data is not just for big cities. The City of Buffalo is also slated to <a href="http://buffalonews.com/2017/01/13/public-input-requested-buffalo-develops-plan-internet-access-city-data/">launch an open data portal soon</a>. Here&#8217;s hoping not only that we see more cities adopting open data, but that Upstate cities begin sharing new ideas and strategies for putting this data to work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">In late 2014, I had a chance to present on the main stage at the annual <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67AXJ_Y1VEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for America Summit</a> in San Francisco. To the surprise of very few people, I was there to talk about cities and data.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1040" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67AXJ_Y1VEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p class="graf graf--p">Earlier that year, I had <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/03/20/chief-data-officer-mark-headd-resign-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished up my term</a> as the first Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, one of the largest cities in the country. But my focus that day was not on big cities like Philadelphia — but rather on smaller cities that had not yet started down the road of leveraging data to spur innovation and inform better policy decisions.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In 2014, the delta between what large cities were doing with data and what small and mid-sized cities were doing <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was pretty stark</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Large cities had embraced open data almost universally and had put in place the policy or technology infrastructure necessary to implement open data or data analytics programs. Nineteen of the top 25 most populous cities had an open data portal or a data policy in place at the time. More than 70% of cities with populations over 500,000 had started down the road to leveraging data to make better decisions or change the way they interacted with residents.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In contrast, relatively few smaller cities had begun that work. Of the 256 incorporated places in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 (based on U.S. Census data), only 39 had adopted a data policy or had implemented an open data portal at that time.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But in the time since I gave that talk, much has changed — largely through the work being done as part of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Works Cities</a> initiative, which was launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2015 to work with mid-sized cities between 100,000 and 1 million in population, and is now partnering with over 75 cities across the country.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Beyond the Big City</h3>
<figure class="graf graf--figure">
<p><div style="width: 1568px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://dataupstate.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/90be3-1adxzemo2ryhliafblw28mq.jpeg?w=1558&#038;h=580" width="1558" height="580" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View of the City of Syracuse.

<p class="graf graf--p">Not long after I gave my talk at the Code for America Summit, I moved back to my hometown of Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Like other Upstate cities, Syracuse has its share of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/syracuses_poverty_rate_remains_among_worst_in_nation_census_finds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/miner_syracuse_water_main_breaks_down_18_percent_but_city_needs_federal_aid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenges</a>, and seems to live perpetually in the shadow of its gigantic Downstate neighbor — New York City — when it comes to technology and innovation. But the work that Syracuse has done over the past few years to adopt new approaches to sharing and using data are impressive and can serve as a model not only for other Upstate cities, but for mid-sized cities across the United States.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Syracuse has fostered several key strategic relationships that have accelerated its adoption of data-driven innovation. Chief among them is the city’s <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/whatworkscities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participation</a> in What Works Cities, through which it has been receiving expert technical assistance in the areas of open data and performance analytics from two of the initiative’s partners, the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://govex.jhu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Government Excellence</a> at Johns Hopkins University and the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunlight Foundation</a>. This tops an impressive resume of other partnerships that the city has leveraged to move the needle on data-driven innovation.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The city has also participated in the Bloomberg Philanthropies <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innovation Teams</a> (or i-teams) program, which fostered the creation of a dedicated group within municipal government to focus on persistent challenges facing the city. One of the first areas of focus for this team was the significant infrastructure issues that have saddled the city for decades. The Syracuse i-team collaborated with the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Science for Social Good</a> project at the University of Chicago to develop a predictive analytic model to help focus limited city resources on the most urgent infrastructure problems. Not only is the city putting the fruits of this partnership to work itself, it is sharing them with other cities using the open source software platform <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/dssg/syracuse_public" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One of the key strategies in Syracuse’s successful adoption of a data and innovation program has been its willingness to import good ideas from other cities and adapt them to its own needs. The city just finished a collaboration with Code for America, which resulted in the development of a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://business.syrgov.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new business registration portal </a>that was a top priority of Mayor Stephanie Miner. Because the project leveraged work that had already been done in Long Beach, California, Syracuse could implement a similar solution faster and with less risk than if it had undertaken the work without following a prior example.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Earlier this year, Syracuse <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/syracuse_fire_department_takes_data-driven_approach_to_getting_smoke_detectors_i.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> a new program to use data to target at-risk properties in the city for distribution of free smoke detectors from the Syracuse Fire Department. This initiative leveraged a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://labs.enigma.io/smoke-signals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data model</a> developed originally for the City of New Orleans and that was in use in a number of other cities across the country. By adapting an idea already at work in other cities, Syracuse could piggyback on the hard work that had already been done and bring results to city residents more efficiently.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">While importing ideas directly from other cities can provide mid-sized cities like Syracuse with a number of advantages, not all ideas translate directly from big cities to smaller ones.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, New York City benefits from the ability to rally its sizable technology community around issues with a civic impact through programs like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.bigapps.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYC Big Apps</a>. Other big cities have also used events like this to marshal their private and nonprofit technology communities around issues with citywide impact. But for other cities, with smaller, less centralized technology communities, sponsoring a stand-alone civic technology event can be a daunting challenge.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Syracuse’s approach of adapting this big-city idea to work on a smaller stage is a great example for other cities to follow. Instead of hosting its own city-sponsored civic tech events, the city has opted instead to tap into an existing network of technologists in the Central New York region. For the past few years, the city had been quietly interested in a biannual event called <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://hackupstate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hack Upstate</a>, held in Downtown Syracuse in the spring and fall of each year. The event consistently attracts a large number of software developers and technologists from across Upstate New York.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In late 2016, the city partnered with Hack Upstate to unveil a new challenge aimed at analyzing data on road conditions in Syracuse. Participants in Hack Upstate could compete for an additional award as part of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://cityofsyracuse.github.io/RoadsChallenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syracuse Road Data Challenge</a>, and many participants opted to use the road data that the city made available to participants to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://medium.com/@hackupstate/hack-upstate-viii-the-results-are-in-4c4f4fb1abf#.kn92n0cc3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">develop new solutions</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Looking at the work that a city like Syracuse has done over the past few years provides some important lessons for how small and mid-sized cities (and even larger cities) can more fully embrace data as a strategic asset and foster innovation.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Leverage a Network</h3>
<figure class="graf graf--figure">
<p><div style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://dataupstate.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/46db9-1hh6cojlwcw2frcdokkri6g.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Syracuse Chief Data Officer Sam Edelstein, Mayor Stephanie Minor, and Dean of the Syracuse University School of Information Studies Elizabeth Liddy launch the Syracuse Roads Challenge.</p></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">While large cities may have some advantages over smaller cities in their ability to drive innovation, one disadvantage they face is that their network of peer cities is relatively small. There are only so many cities the size of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami — only 10 cities in the U.S have populations over 1 million. In contrast, there are about 250 cities in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Programs like What Works Cities provide small and mid-sized cities with a valuable opportunity to connect and collaborate with their peers, including an upcoming second annual <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summit</a> in New York City in which hundreds of mayors, city leaders and frontline practitioners will gather to learn from experts and exchange ideas. And a new certification program being rolled out by What Works Cities will provide an opportunity for even more cities to participate in the initiative and join its growing network; any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more will be welcome to apply.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">As cities like Syracuse have demonstrated, being able to leverage ideas from peers is a key component of driving innovation and adopting data-driven strategies.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Ruthless Adaptation of Ideas</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The real power of open source software (the idea that the code that makes up software solutions should be freely available to all) and open data is that it enables one to build on the work of others — to adapt someone else’s work to solve your own problem. The principles behind open source and open data allow smaller cities to borrow ideas from other places and to punch above their weight on innovation.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Cities like Syracuse are great at ruthlessly adapting ideas that are at work in other places to solve their own local problems and improve the ways they provide services to residents. But knowing where to look to find good ideas can often be a challenge; smaller cities need to know which cities are leading the way in using data to allocate scarce resources more efficiently or inform new policy choices.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">What Works Cities promises to address this challenge through its new certification program, which establishes a comprehensive standard for evaluating the data and evidence work being done in cities. This new standard will help to identify and nationally recognize the work of cities that are excelling in how they use data to transform what they do and allow other cities to emulate their efforts by borrowing their best ideas.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is the way that small and mid-sized cities will drive innovation and the adoption of data-driven governance in the years ahead.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/releases/twelve-cities-join-works-cities-expanding-wave-local-government-leaders-accelerating-use-data-evidence-improve-lives/">Buffalo</a> joined the growing ranks of cities in the What Works Cities program. And just this week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/releases/what-works-cities-halfway-goal-supporting-100-mid-sized-us-cities/">Syracuse</a> also became a What Works Cities program member. Coming on the heels of a successful <a href="https://ischool.syr.edu/landing-pages/civic-data-hackathon-syracuse-roads-challenge">civic data challenge</a> in Central New York that partnered with the successful <a href="http://hackupstate.com/">Hack Upstate</a> biannual hackathon and AT&amp;T, this bodes well for Upstate.</p>
<p>As more and more cities like Syracuse and Buffalo embrace open data and build partnerships with outside data users, they&#8217;ll learn to use data more effectively and foster the growth of innovative new solutions.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to watch as this new program ramps up in these two Upstate cities and new open data sets get released to the public.</p>
<p>And it would be terrific to see another Upstate city join the ranks of What Works Cities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Last August, a </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/architecture-of-segregation/"><span style="font-weight:400;">study from the Century Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> identified cities in Upstate New York as places with some of the highest concentrations of poverty for African American and Hispanic populations anywhere in the nation. The problem is particularly acute in the City of Syracuse which holds the  distinction of having the highest level of poverty concentration among African American and Hispanic populations of the one hundred largest metropolitan areas in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This problem isn’t Syracuse’s alone &#8211; the study shows that Rochester and Buffalo also have serious problems with concentrated poverty. But the Salt City is an unfortunate standout in this report. In addition to have the highest concentrations of poverty among African Americans and Hispanics, when looking at concentrated poverty among non-Hispanic whites “&#8230;Detroit, Fresno, and Syracuse are the only metropolitan areas on all three lists.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Century Foundation&#8217;s findings echo those of an </span><a href="http://media.syracuse.com/news/other/2014/11/17/CNY-Fair-Housing-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">earlier study</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with a similar scope conducted by CNY Fair Housing, Inc. which found that the Syracuse area is “one of the worst scoring cities in the country when looking at equality of opportunity based on race and ethnicity.” Given what we know about how </span><a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11852640/cartoon-poor-neighborhoods"><span style="font-weight:400;">concentrated poverty affects the life outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for people who live in it, it’s hard to imagine a more serious drag on the growth and well being of our region than deliberately forcing people to live in places where they are surrounded by poverty and given them few options of getting out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But that’s exactly what we do.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-150"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8230;[W]e are witnessing a nationwide return of concentrated poverty that is racial in nature, and &#8230; this expansion and continued existence of high-poverty ghettos and barrios is no accident. These neighborhoods are not the value-free outcome of the impartial workings of the housing market. Rather, in large measure, they are the inevitable and predictable consequences of deliberate policy choices.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8212; Paul Jargowsky, the Architecture of Segregation</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Syracuse&#8217;s issues with poverty and neighborhood decline are not an accident. Like many other cities, Syracuse still shows the scars of <a href="http://syracusethenandnow.org/Redlining/HOLC_Maps.htm">redlining</a> and other discriminatory practices that prevented investment in specific neighborhoods deemed at the time to be undesirable. Looking at <a href="http://syracusethenandnow.org/Redlining/OldRedlining/HOLC_Maps/Syracuse%201937%20Redline%20Map.pdf">redline maps of Syracuse from the 1930&#8217;s</a> shows a disturbing correlation with neighborhoods that are now struggling with concentrated poverty.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our contemporary problems with poverty in Central New York are also not accidental &#8211; they are the result of conscious policy decisions made by government officials in our region and are further amplified by federal and state tax policy. The cumulative impact of these policies has left the Central New York region </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/report_syracuse_and_onondaga_county_suffer_from_hyper-segregation.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">deeply segregated</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and with unrivaled levels of concentrated poverty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Improving our community will require us not only to understand how these policy decisions are made and how they contribute to the concentration of poverty, it will require those of us in Central New York not living in areas of high poverty to understand how we are complicit in these decisions. But even beyond this, reversing the concentration of poverty in our region will require political courage and strong leadership from county, state and federal officials.</span></p>
<p><b>The Cost of Complexity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, the </span><a href="https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Commission on Local Government Consolidation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (the Consensus Commission) issued a </span><a href="https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/docs/1.26.16_Consensus_PRELIM_RECCS_REPORT.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">preliminary report</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> outlining some options for streamlining the administration of local government in Central New York. Under the unifying theme of “we can do better” the Commission listed a host of different areas where local services are duplicative and wasteful. A community wide discussion on the potential benefits of government consolidation has ensued. Though the issue of concentrated poverty is touched on briefly in the Consensus Commission report, one of the primary factors contributing to the problem is buried near the end and not deeply examined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Land use planning (discussed on page 69 of the Consensus Commission report) &#8211; the rules governing what kinds of structures and buildings get built in our community, and where they may be located &#8211; is highly decentralized in Onondaga County, scattered across many local jurisdictions. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">In total, we estimate that more than 550 board members are involved in land use and planning activities across Onondaga County – nearly 200 municipal board members, 195 planning board members, and 169 zoning board members. Each municipality possesses its own zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, and other local laws / ordinances related to planning.</span></i></p>
<p><em>&#8212; Commission on Local Government Modernization, Options Report &amp; Preliminary Committee Recommendations</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Even more important, there is a lack of a comprehensive, enforceable land use plan for the entire county to guide this vast collection of local officials. This means that each local governments in Onondaga County has latitude for establishing its own set of rules for land use within its jurisdiction, with no enforceable central coordination at the county or regional level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is a recipe for </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/facts/understanding-exclusionary-zoning-impact-concentrated-poverty/"><span style="font-weight:400;">exclusionary zoning practices</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, which occur when wealthier suburban jurisdictions enact land use restrictions that drive up the cost of housing and crowd out affordable accommodations.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Traditionally, exclusionary zoning policies have kept poor, central city residents out of suburbs with minimum lot size requirements, single residence per lot requirements, minimum square footage requirements, and costly building codes. Together, these requirements make it difficult to build multi-family rental units that would allow lower-income residents to live in wealthy suburban developments with access to quality schools and employment.</span></i></p>
<p><em>&#8212; Elliott Anne Rigsby, Understanding Exclusionary Zoning and Its Impact on Concentrated Poverty</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In other words, low-income residents are priced out of the suburbs by land use decisions that get made by a decentralized collection of small local boards. It is the collective impact of these parochial decisions that has resulted the level of concentrated poverty we see in Syracuse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This issue was raised long before the Consensus Commission report, and before the Century Foundation report singled out Syracuse for its unmatched level of concentrated poverty. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">In a 2014, the </span><a href="http://media.syracuse.com/news/other/2014/11/17/CNY-Fair-Housing-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">CNY Fair Housing, Inc. study</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> found that</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8230;in many parts of the county, exclusionary zoning policies exist that drive up the cost of developing new housing. This includes large minimum lot size or coverage requirements.  In addition, the County has identified that the lack of uniform procedures among the 34 municipalities within the County Consortium increases the cost of developing housing. This lack of uniformity also reduces transparency in the system, making it more difficult to monitor how the municipalities are working to further fair housing.</span></i></p>
<p><em>&#8212; CNY Fair Housing, Analysis of impediments to Fair Housing</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Concentrated poverty in Syracuse is not new &#8211; the problem has festered and deepened over decades (particularly over the last decade and a half according to the Century Foundation report). It is also not accidental &#8211; the cumulative impact of local land use decisions made by hundreds of different local officials in isolation and tax benefits enjoyed disproportionately by residents in wealthier suburban areas all contribute to the severity of the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We all carry some of the blame for pushing our community to the brink. </span></p>
<p><b>Subsidizing Poverty</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/architecture-of-segregation/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Century Foundation Report</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> provides a clear (and disturbing) picture of concentrated poverty in </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse &#8211; but this only shows one part of the picture. Exclusionary zoning practices and suburban subsidization drives up the cost of home ownership outside of the City of Syracuse &#8211; putting it out of reach for low and moderate income families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Using data from </span><a href="http://www.zillow.com/research/data/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Zillow</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, we can get a glimpse of the rest of the picture, and clearly see the disparity in homeownership costs between the poorer sections of the City of Syracuse and more wealth suburban towns and villages.</span></p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.carto.com/viz/793dbc1a-3c94-11e6-9457-0ecfd53eb7d3/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/793dbc1a-3c94-11e6-9457-0ecfd53eb7d3/public_map"><span style="font-weight:400;">This map shows median home values</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by zip code in Onondaga County as of May 31, 2016. With this view, we get a clearer picture of the impact of exclusionary zoning outside the urban center &#8211; median home values in the suburbs far outpace those in the city. To illustrate this point, consider the <strong>13205</strong> zip code (which encompasses the South side of the City of Syracuse) and the directly adjacent <strong>13078</strong> zip code (which covers the Town of DeWitt). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Median home values in the <strong>13205</strong> zip code in May of this year was $62,500 while those in the <strong>13078</strong> zip code was $225,000 &#8211; a difference of over 350%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s worse &#8211; the impact of exclusionary zoning gets magnified by federal and state tax policies that allow wealthier homeowners to deduct things like </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p936.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">mortgage interest</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and local real estate taxes. These benefits are used disproportionately by higher income taxpayers and provide bigger benefits for homeowners with larger mortgages and bigger tax bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Using </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi"><span style="font-weight:400;">zip code data from the IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for 2013, we can map the differences in </span><a href="https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/1496309a-3d3d-11e6-b795-0e5db1731f59/public_map"><span style="font-weight:400;">mortgage interest</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/f1c7a7d7-4d19-408a-b4f8-c7ce5b818cb3/public_map"><span style="font-weight:400;">real estate taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> reported on taxpayer returns. The amounts shown in the map below are an average of the deduction amounts reported by zip code, showing the relative benefit of these deduction to individual taxpayers inside and outside the City of Syracuse.</span></p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.carto.com/viz/1496309a-3d3d-11e6-b795-0e5db1731f59/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>With the exception of a small area in Downtown Syracuse, we can see that the deeper blue colors (representing larger benefits) are almost totally in outlying suburban areas &#8211; this subsidy effect is even starker for real estate taxes.</p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.carto.com/viz/f1c7a7d7-4d19-408a-b4f8-c7ce5b818cb3/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the urban <strong>13205</strong> zip code the average mortgage interest reported on individual returns was about $3,500 and the average real estate taxes reported was about $3,100. In contrast, the <strong>13104</strong> zip code in the Eastern part of the county saw an average mortgage interest of over $7,000 and the average real estate taxes reported over $10,000. These amounts were even higher in the <strong>13152</strong> zip code in the far western part of the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The small area in Downtown Syracuse that saw higher average mortgage interest and real estate taxes reported than the rest of the city likely reflects some recent redevelopment efforts, particularly in the Armory Square area. The overall impact of these tax benefits inside the city is quite low though &#8211; the number of returns in this zip code number only a few hundred, while the number of returns reporting these deductible amounts in the suburbs numbered in the thousands,.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">These federal and state tax policies act as a sort of hidden government subsidy for suburban homeowners, deepening the impact of zoning decisions that get made by a maze of local boards and officials. Taken together, the combined impact of these varied policy decisions that get made at different levels of government is to institutionalize a system that encourages higher income homeowners to leave the City of Syracuse and forces lower income homeowners (or would be homeowners) to remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The disorganized nature of these various decisions does give us some wiggle room &#8211; there’s enough space for deniability, to convince ourselves that this is just a “city problem.” But the increasingly concentrated level of poverty we see in Syracuse is not accidental. It is the result of deliberate policy decisions that touch every homeowner in our region &#8211; whether we live in the City of Syracuse or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Everyone&#8217;s hands are a little dirty &#8211; there&#8217;s no smoking gun like with redlining in the 1930&#8217;s and 40&#8217;s but a fog of uneven outcomes and easy excuses hangs over our entire community.</span></p>
<p>We are all complicit in this outcome. And we all have a stake in fixing it.</p>
<p><b>Fixing our Broken Community</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Reversing the level of concentrated poverty in the City of Syracuse is a key to our region’s growth and long-term prosperity. There simply aren&#8217;t any examples of areas in our country with growing economies and populations that have an urban core with the as many problems as ours does. We can&#8217;t hide out in the peace of the suburbs any more and pretend the problems aren&#8217;t ours. It&#8217;s as simple as that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s hard to imagine a realistic plan for economic and community growth that doesn’t address our area’s problems with poverty. And since the factors that created this problem are the result of policy decisions made largely outside of the city, it’s hard to overstate how important it is for real leadership on this issue by county, state and federal officials &#8211; not just for Syracuse, but for other Upstate cities as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fixing this problem will take time, but there are some things we can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">First, let’s hold our county officials accountable when they decide to </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/business-news/index.ssf/2015/09/tax_breaks_approved_for_luxury_apartment_homes_in_lysander.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">subsidize luxury housing in the suburbs</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This is just terrible public policy given the current level of poverty concentration in our region’s urban core, and underscores just how rudderless our county’s land use decision making is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Let’s use the </span><a href="https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/"><span style="font-weight:400;">local dialog happening</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> around the Consensus Commission plan to advocate for centralized land use planning and an enforceable land use plan for Onondaga County. Of all of the many opportunities for consolidation identified in the Consensus Commission plan, this is the one with the biggest potential benefit for our community. If we failed to pursue every other consolidation opportunity but this one, our region could still see enormous benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finally, let’s insist to our state and federal elected officials that any economic development or growth plan they support should include &#8211; as a central component &#8211; addressing concentrated poverty in Upstate cities. This problem is not Syracuse’s alone and it’s hard to imagine an economic  growth plan for the Upstate region being in any way effective if it ignores the fact that we have large portions of our urban populations trapped in poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our current County Executive grew up in the City of Syracuse and the New York State Senate Deputy Majority Leader is a lifelong Syracuse resident. The work of the Consensus Commission has been sanctioned and supported by the Governor, and has largely been received well in our community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We seem to have the requisite political clout to begin addressing the problem of concentrated poverty in Syracuse in a real and lasting way. </span></p>
<p>Let’s not miss the chance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting a speeding ticket in the State of New York can be a traumatic &#8211; and expensive &#8211; experience.</p>
<p>Drivers convicted of speeding often face <a href="http://www.dmv.org/ny-new-york/traffic-ticket-fines-and-penalties.php">penalties and fines</a>, and repeated or excessive offenses can result in the loss of a license. But in some places in New York State, drivers issued a speeding ticket may see a very different outcome than one would typically expect: a smaller fine, the avoidance of long-term penalties, and &#8211; oddly enough &#8211; additional money in local government coffers.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote a post detailing some data science techniques that <a href="https://civic.io/2015/02/03/command-line-data-science/">used a data set from the State of New York</a> on traffic violations. This is an <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Four-Year-Window/q4hy-kbtf">incredibly rich data set</a> and it&#8217;s awesome that the state makes this available as open data. However, the issuance of traffic tickets only tells part of a larger story &#8211; since the release of this initial data set, the state has now released data on <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">traffic ticket convictions</a>. Comparing both of these data sets allows us to see the full picture of what happens when a traffic ticket is issued in the State of New York, from issuance all the way through to adjudication.</p>
<p>An examination of these data sets show that &#8211; in certain areas of the state &#8211; tickets issued for speeding are much more likely to be negotiated down to a lessor offense that allows drivers to avoid a penalty from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and actually provides a backdoor benefit for local governments.</p>
<p><span id="more-147"></span></p>
<p><strong>A Lesser Offense </strong></p>
<p>There is a longstanding practice in New York State that allows local courts where traffic violations are adjudicated to accept a plea bargain for a lessor offense from some drivers that are issued tickets for speeding. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any hard and fast set of rules governing this behavior, but what I have found through research suggests that at the judge or prosecutor&#8217;s discretion motorists that don&#8217;t have prior speeding violations and/or weren&#8217;t speeding excessively may be allowed to plead down to a non-moving violation. These lessor offenses typically aren&#8217;t reported to DMV so they don&#8217;t result in <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/about-nys-driver-point-system">points against a driver&#8217;s license</a>. The fines owed for these non-moving violations may be lower than the fines for speeding, and because of the nature of the offense all of the fine revenue goes to the local jurisdiction, not the state.</p>
<p>This would seem to create a perverse incentive for local jurisdictions to allow drivers to plead down speeding tickets, and some proposals have been made to <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20130126/cityandregion/130129321/1010">alter the practice</a>. Funding municipal operations through fines and penalties has led to <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-ferguson-missouri-court-fines-budget.html">serious issues in other parts of the country</a>, and we should be concerned that this practice may result in an uneven (and unfair) application of the law. Whether or not a motorist should be allowed to plead down to a lesser offense should be based on factors other than whether the local jurisdiction wants or needs the revenue to fund their operations.</p>
<p>Now &#8211; thanks to the State of New York&#8217;s open data efforts &#8211; we have data that can be used to determine how widespread this practice is, and make some recommendations for what policy makers should do going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at the Data</strong></p>
<p>Once the data from the state&#8217;s portal is loaded into a local <acronym title="Relational Database management System">RDBMS</acronym> (more on this in the technical notes below), we can run queries against it. For the purposes of this analysis, we wanted to determine the <em>conviction rate</em> for speeding tickets for each local court in the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">convictions data set</a>. To do this, we need to count up the number of tickets issued for speeding violations that get assigned to each local court and compare it the number of convictions for speeding offenses for that court. In other words:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>speeding convictions / speeding tickets issues = conviction rate</strong></p>
<p>In running queries against the data, it probably makes sense to limit our analysis to jurisdictions where a non-trivial number of speeding tickets are issued. If pleading down tickets to lesser offenses creates an unwanted incentive for local officials, this is probably more likely to occur in places the local revenue generated from this practice is more significant.</p>
<p>So, if we restrict our analysis to jurisdictions where 10,000 or more speeding tickets were issued over the four year period covered by the state&#8217;s data, we get the following.</p>

</pre>
<p>At the top of the list &#8211; meaning places that have the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">lowest</span> conviction rates for speeding tickets issued &#8211; we see the City of Tonawanda (not to be confused with the Town of Tonawanda, which is also on the list)  located in Western New York near Buffalo. The rate of conviction on speeding tickets in the City of Tonawanda is about 7.5%. The Town of Hamburg and the Town of Amherst &#8211; which also have very low conviction rates for speeding tickets &#8211; are also in Western NY.</p>
<p>Overall, the list includes areas with major highways and significant traffic levels &#8211; Clarkstown, Yonkers, Suffolk and Southampton are all downstate and Long Island, and Troy and Guilderland are in the Capital Region &#8211; which are places where we would expect to see lots of traffic tickets issued. If we look at how the practice of pleading down traffic violations plays out in terms of local revenue, we can see that it may provide significant support for some jurisdictions. In the <a href="http://www.ci.tonawanda.ny.us/treasurer/budget_2015_and_supporting_documentation.pdf">City of Tanowanda</a>, fine revenue represents about $475,000 annually &#8211; about 6.5% of total city revenue (excluding state aid). Not the largest revenue source by any stretch, but certainly enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the list &#8211; meaning places that have the highest rates of convictions for speeding tickets are the various <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/find-tvb-office-locations">Traffic Violation Bureaus</a>. These are run by the state DMV, so there is no incentive to plead down speeding tickets to lesser offenses and generate local revenue. In fact, I don&#8217;t think plea bargains are allowed at these facilities. This means that for some areas &#8211; like Western NY &#8211; drivers may see the final adjudication of their speeding ticket handled very differently depending on where it is issued (or, more accurately, depending on the court it is assigned to).</p>
<p>Around the City of Buffalo there are a number of jurisdictions &#8211; Tonawanda, Amherst, Hamburg, Cheektowanga &#8211; that have very low conviction rates for speeding tickets. But within the City of Buffalo (where speeding tickets are adjudicated by the Traffic Violation Bureau) the conviction rates are much higher.</p>
<p><strong>Where Do We Go From Here?</strong></p>
<p>The current situation, where drivers issued speeding tickets are allowed to plead down to lesser offenses and generate local revenue, seems far from ideal for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>The practice of supporting municipal operations through penalty and fine revenue can create <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/doj-warns-local-courts-in-u-s-about-use-of/article_b9b8afd6-74e1-5303-ae3d-c3492514714e.html">perverse incentives</a> and undermine people&#8217;s confidence in the impartiality of government officials. Because there are no hard and fast rules governing how different jurisdictions allow drivers to plead to lesser offenses, there is no way to make sure that this opportunity is being evenly applied. Do men and women plead at the same rate? Do minorities plead at the same rate as whites? The data currently available don&#8217;t allow us to evaluate these questions, but the quasi-formal nature of the practice should raise concerns.</p>
<p>Moreover, the incentive created by this practice should be particularly concerning from a traffic safety perspective. The penalties and fines established for speeding are put in place for a reason &#8211; <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.21798/abstract">they work</a>, by reducing the incidence of fatal accidents and loss of life. Permitting speeders a chance to plea to a lesser offense allows potentially dangerous drivers to remain on the road with little consequence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all state policy makers see it this way. In Buffalo &#8211; where this analysis shows the imbalance between conviction rates is stark &#8211; state legislators have in recent years <a href="http://wivb.com/2014/06/20/coming-soon-to-buffalo-talking-down-traffic-tickets/">moved to allow speeders in the city to plead to a lesser offense</a>, the same opportunity afforded ticketed drivers in surrounding towns and villages.</p>
<p>This is a move in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Local governments &#8211; particularly in Upstate New York &#8211; are strapped financially, burdened by crumbling infrastructure and face a host of challenges in funding their operations. But we should not allow the practice of pleading down speeding tickets to be used as a way to provide a financial crutch to New York&#8217;s ailing local governments. Policy makers should eliminate this practice altogether.</p>
<p>Supporting local governments shouldn&#8217;t require making our highways and roadways less safe.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Notes: Here&#8217;s How I Obtained and Used the Data</strong></p>
<p>The logic for calculating conviction rates is contained in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-conviction-rate-sql">couple of stored procedures</a> &#8211; one to determine the conviction rate for speeding tickets for a given year, and the other to calculate it over the four year period that both data sets cover (this is the one used to generate the table shown above). This is obviously not to most elegant or efficient SQL, but for the purposes of this analysis it will do the job.</p>
<p>All of the data used in this analysis is available from the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/">State of New York&#8217;s open data portal</a> and cover the period from 2011 &#8211; 2014. Specifically, I make use of the traffic ticket data set <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Four-Year-Window/q4hy-kbtf">here</a>, and the traffic ticket conviction data set <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">here</a>. Since I want to combine data from both sets, I opted to download both and load them into a local RDBMS so I could run <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> queries on them.</p>
<p>The traffic ticket data set is rather large &#8211; over 14 million rows. It contains one record for each ticket issued along with descriptive information about the violation, when it was issued and the court it was assigned to for adjudication. For the purposes of this analysis, we are interested in tickets issued for speeding, so we confine our queries to a subset of all tickets with the set of descriptions <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-violation-descriptions-md">listed here</a>. This list was generated by selecting violation descriptions with the word <code>SPEED</code> in them &#8211; a little simplistic but not a bad way to start. A few of the ticket categories seem out of place &#8211; like <code>UNLAWFUL SPEEDOMETER</code> and <code>VEH WITH PERFORMANCE SPEED LESS THAN 55 MPH REG-9</code> &#8211; so for now, we&#8217;ll drop them from our analysis.</p>
<p>The conviction data set contains aggregate counts of convictions for specific violation types (in this analysis, I focused on <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-conviction-descriptions-md">this set</a>). Since these are aggregate counts, we can&#8217;t tie specific tickets to an outcome in a local court (at least not with these data sets). However, we can look at each court and sum up the types of convictions that occur for a given time period. Since the ticket data set includes information on the court each ticket was assigned to, we can create a view of how many tickets issued for speeding in the State of New York were plead down to lesser offenses and in which jurisdictions the practice is more prevalent.</p>
<p>I should note that the conviction data set needed a bit of tweaking before I could conduct this analysis. The format for the <code>Court_Name</code> field was slightly different from the ticket data set, and this was the field I wanted to use to match ticket counts to conviction counts. Using <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>, I was able to modify this data set and add a new column named <code>Standard_Court_Name</code> that used the same naming convention as the ticket data set. As such, the table structure for this data set in my local database <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-data-load-sql">differs slightly</a> from the structure of the data available on the NYS data portal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Municipal governments devote non-trivial resources conducting food safety inspections. These inspections require considerable bureaucratic infrastructure and highly trained staff, and play an essential part in protecting the public health.</p>
<p>And yet, despite this investment of time and resources many governments miss easy opportunities to extract additional value from this data that can further enhance efforts to protect public health and offer new insights into their communities. Here are some easy ways that local governments can get more value from food safety inspection results.</p>
<p><span id="more-119"></span></p>
<p><strong>Engage with Partners &amp; Collaborators</strong></p>
<p>In Onondaga County, food safety inspections are conducted by the County Health Department. Like other counties, Onondaga County reports these results to the state where they are aggregated and made available in a variety of formats. This is important &#8211; and we&#8217;ll discuss more about state-level open data below &#8211; but it represents something of a missed opportunity for Onondaga County, as currently the Health Department just provides an embedded view of the <a href="http://www.ongov.net/health/foodprotection.html">aggregated state-level data on its public web site</a>. Other Upstate counties do this as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great that this data is made available, but it&#8217;s not the most user friendly or efficient way to allow the general public to view (or search for) specific restaurant inspection results. This is data that is in the interest of the County to share as broadly and widely as possible, and yet no effort is made to engage with potential partners outside government that could do new and creative things with this data.</p>
<p>Because this data is already hosted on the <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Food-Service-Establishment-Last-Inspection/cnih-y5dw">NY State Open Data Portal</a>, it is perfectly positioned to be used by software developers and others in creating new applications. Making this data easy to search and more relevant to citizens as the make choices about where to dine can have a significant impact on public health by allowing people to make more informed choices. Moreover, as food services establishments become aware that this data is more easily accessible in a variety of different applications, it can provide a powerful incentive for them to take these inspections more seriously.</p>
<p>Best of all, since this data is already aggregated and hosted by the state there is a marginal cost of $0 to municipal governments for every new application or service that incorporates this data.</p>

<p>As an example of how this data might be used to provide new viewing and searching options, consider <a href="http://eatsafecny.org/">EatSafeCNY</a> &#8211; a web-based application that uses data specifically for Onondaga County and makes it easy to search, view and share inspection results. This application is built with open source components, is hosted on a free web service and was created at virtually no cost in a few short days. This is just one of any number of different apps that could be built to share this data more broadly.</p>
<p>In order to leverage the value of the data in this way, Onondaga County officials need to reach out to the local technology community, to signal to them that they are open to and encourage use of this data in new ways. In the absence of this outreach, awareness of the opportunity to use this data may be low and interest in building new apps may be stymied if it is not viewed as an important priority by county officials.</p>
<p><strong>Uncover Local Insights</strong></p>
<p>As touched on in <a href="https://dataupstate.org/2016/07/13/state-data-local-insights/">a previous post</a>, food safety inspection data can also be useful for local officials in providing new insights into business activity in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Some local governments require additional permitting for different classes of businesses, and enforcement of local ordinances requiring these additional permits can sometimes be a challenge. For example, the <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589935988">City of Rochester</a> requires restaurants to obtain a business permit as a condition of operating in the city. In addition, <a href="http://www2.monroecounty.gov/eh-food.php">Monroe County</a> &#8211; in which the City of Rochester is located &#8211; also requires restaurants to obtain a permit, but through a  separate process (this is the list of permitted businesses that is used to conduct food safety inspections).</p>
<p>But what if an restaurant establishment in Rochester is unaware of the permit requirement from the city, or intentionally avoids registering with the city? Using county inspection data which is aggregated and made open by the state, it is possible to see if there are restaurants located in the City of Rochester that have registered with Monroe County and not the city. (It is also possible to use <a href="https://dataupstate.org/2016/07/13/state-data-for-upstate-governments/">other data sources</a> to identify unpermitted businesses as well.)</p>
<p>But this is just one example how using data from other governments can generate local insights. And while staff time and expertise to conduct this kind of work might be limited, there is often expertise (and desire) in the broader data community to help with projects like these. Other cities have developed collaborative relationships with universities and other groups of data users with an interest in working on real world projects with positive a local impact.</p>
<p>By making outreach to outside innovators and data users a priority, local governments can derive significant value and insights from existing data and provide better service to their citizens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moving services online can generate significant convenience benefits for citizens and cost benefits for governments.</p>
<p>Allowing citizens to submit data online can <a href="https://dataupstate.org/2016/07/18/simple-tricks-to-get-better-data/">help ensure better data quality</a>, and online payment means governments can access funds more quickly and more efficiently. Citizens get the convenience of 24/7 availability and the ability to pay with a credit card. Even for citizens that face challenges accessing the internet there can be benefits to allowing online or app-based options for services &#8211; this can give governments the ability to allocate more expensive resources (typically people) to better serve citizens that may need more intensive assistance.</p>
<p>But providing the option to submit a form or make a payment online doesn&#8217;t always guarantee that citizens will exercise the option. Poorly designed websites and clunky online forms can discourage citizens from using these options. Looking critically at online service options and using data to enhance them can be the key to getting more people to use them &#8211; allowing governments to realize the benefits of these more efficient online options.</p>
<p><span id="more-97"></span></p>
<p><strong>Help Me Help You</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common types of payments a citizen will make to a local government is for a parking citation. In fact, citizens may opt to pay a parking citation they might otherwise contest if the cost of the citation is not onerous and the process for paying is relatively easier than adjudicating it.</p>
<p>Yet, there are many examples where online payment of parking citations could be made simpler and more convenient for citizens if  governments improved them with data that they already maintain.</p>
<p>Consider the example of the City of Albany&#8217;s online <a href="http://www.albanyny.org/Home/Payments.aspx">parking citation payment solution</a>. This is a convenient option for anyone that gets a parking citation in the City of Albany, but in order to use it a citizen must have a citation number &#8211; something not everyone might have ready access to. In addition, what if someone wanted to search for any outstanding parking violations by searching on their license plate number (parents with teenaged drivers might fall into this category)? This is a situation where a citizen is ready to make a payment, yet the existing service does not allow them the option &#8211; a missed opportunity for the city.</p>
<p>The option to pay using a citation number, or to search for outstanding citations using a license plate or tag number is <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/parking-clerk/how-pay-parking-ticket">common in larger cities</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically, Albany already makes parking citation data <a href="https://data.albanyny.gov/City-Finances/Outstanding-Parking-Tickets-07-1-16/w6nr-kwzp">available as open data</a>, including the license plate number of vehicles that have been issued citations. The city already has this data available in a ready to use format that would make it easy for a citizen to look up all citations by their vehicle license plate number and then make a payment on any outstanding citations. In fact, this is so easy to do that <a href="http://capitaltickets.org/">a simple open source solution</a> can be built quickly and easily at virtually no cost.</p>
<p>By simply using data it already makes available as open data to everyone else &#8211; or <a href="https://dataupstate.org/2016/07/20/improving-public-health-with-open-data/">encouraging others</a> to do it &#8211; the City of Albany could enhance an existing online payment option and make it easier for citizens to pay more outstanding citations.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Selling Services</strong></p>
<p>When citizens visit a government website to make a payment or submit an application, governments have an opportunity to serve them more effectively by identifying other payment or service options that are available to them. This idea is fairly common in the world of online retail &#8211; consider the recommendations presented to a user when they purchase something on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> &#8211; but it is still relatively rare in the world of online government services.</p>
<p>Typically, when a user visits a government website to make a payment they leave once the payment is complete. But what if users were prompted to engage in another transaction, particularly one that was relevant to their interests, or their location. Some <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/08/06/organ-donation-and-ab-testing/">work done by the Government Digital Service in the United Kingdom</a> suggests that prompting users to engage in another transaction after they have completed their first transaction can have an impact.</p>
<p>When a citizen visits a government website to make a payment for their water bill, they will need to provide the address for their account &#8211; governments can use this information to custom tailor additional payment or service opportunities. For example, if a jurisdiction has <a href="https://dataupstate.org/2016/07/18/simple-tricks-to-get-better-data/">standardized address data across departments</a> they could easily determine if the property was due for a real estate tax payment, had outstanding code violations, or even remind the citizen when refuse collection was occurring in their location.</p>
<p>Each transaction that occurs between a  citizen and government can potentially be used as a way to provide better services by &#8220;cross selling&#8221; additional relevant information and transactions to citizens.[1]</p>
<p>Moving services online can benefit both citizens and governments. By using data &#8211; much of which they already have &#8211; governments can squeeze every ounce of benefit from these online transactions, and provide higher quality services to those they serve.</p>
<p>[1] The term &#8220;cross selling&#8221; as it relates to online government services has been used extensively by <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/25354/pdf-italia-tom-steinberg-explored-5-digital-asks-we-should-make-our-government">Tom Steinberg</a>, the founder and former director of mySociety.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common impediments governments face in making better use of their data &#8211; and releasing it to the public &#8211; is data quality.</p>
<p>Since much of the data that municipal governments maintain and use relates to a specific location, ensuring that address data is complete and accurate can make this data much easier to use, and much more valuable. There are some easy techniques that government can utilize to better ensure that address information &#8211; whether submitted by citizens themselves or collected in other ways &#8211; is as complete and accurate as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, once collected, taking steps to standardize address information can make it much easier to share within municipal government, as well as with other governments and external data users.</p>
<p><span id="more-70"></span></p>
<p><strong>Collecting Good Data</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to enhance data quality is to make it easy for citizens to submit good information in the first place. Every form that citizens use to interact with your jurisdiction &#8211; to obtain a permit or license, to submit a service request, etc. &#8211; is a chance to capture accurate information from them.</p>
<p>Web-based form submissions are a common way for most citizens to interact with their local government, and &#8211; properly designed &#8211; can help ensure your government gets the most accurate information possible directly from citizens. An effective way of ensuring that accurate address information gets collected when citizens or businesses submit a web form is to use an <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-addressform">address autocomplete service</a>.</p>
<p>This simple web service is incorporated into web-based forms and assists users in entering valid addresses in a form that is optimized for internal use.  An example of how an autocomplete service can make address entry easier for citizens and more accurate for government can be seen below.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mheadd/address-autocomplete/gh-pages/autocomplete.gif" width="1464" height="702" /></p>
<p>Creating an autocomplete service is straightforward and low in cost &#8211; data on street names and subdivision names is available from a variety of sources at no charge. Both the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a> and the <a href="http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/inventories/details.cfm?DSID=921">NYS GIS Clearinghouse</a> make this data available for any Upstate government to use.</p>
<p><strong>Standardizing Existing Data</strong></p>
<p>If your jurisdiction collects address data on forms or applications, chances are that this data exists in a variety of formats across different agencies or departments. The quality of this address data may vary greatly depending on how it was collected and how it is maintained.</p>
<p>One way to make this data more usable and more valuable is to standardize it across all departments, and to ensure that it is properly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding">geocoded</a>. This allows users to view a much richer (and more complete) history for a specific property by enabling them to combine data from across different departments &#8211; and even combine it with data from different government entities.</p>
<p>It can also benefit efforts that are focused on understanding or optimizing how things work on a city or county-wide scale. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a relationship between the location of specific licensed businesses &#8211; or type of businesses &#8211; and calls to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1">311</a> (or 911)?</li>
<li>Are permits or licenses from one department being issued to properties with outstanding violations or complaints from another department?</li>
<li>Are local businesses in compliance with state or county permitting requirements but out of compliance with local requirements?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the many questions that governments should consider as they work to improve the level of service they are providing. Each of these questions requires address data to be standardized across multiple local agencies.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways standardize address data, and your jurisdiction may have access to a tool or utility that can compare raw addresses submitted by a citizen on a form or application to an authoritative source. The NYS GIS Clearinghouse provides <a href="http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/inventories/details.cfm?DSID=1278">a public geocoder services</a> that can be used to standardize addresses data and to provide geospatial information. This service uses authoritative data collected from each county &#8211; and while it is continually being refined and enhanced, this is a powerful resource for any local government that wants to enhance its existing data by standardizing addresses and adding geospatial data. The U.S. Census Bureau provides <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/geocoder.html">a similar service</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally, once an address has been standardized it can be assigned a unique identifier that can be used across departments that refer to the same piece of property when discussing services delivered by different departments.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Data</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common impediments to sharing data both inside governments and with outside users is data quality. Even if your internal government departments &#8211; and external data users &#8211; have access to your data, they may face challenges in using it efficiently because of a non-standard address format.</p>
<p>Having an internal dialog about address standardization can be beneficial in a much deeper way for local governments as well. These conversations encourage departments to look at property data collectively, which can help surface issues with different departments maintaining their own customized information about a property.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t all that uncommon, as different departments may view the same parcel of land through the lens of their own specific service or activity.  The tax assessors office, water department, zoning office and other agencies may all have a different view of a parcel or address and maintain slightly different information about it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goals of a local government and the people it serves are better realized when these different views are unified &#8211; encouraging more meaningful data sharing both inside and outside of government.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with <a href="https://dataupstate.org/2016/06/22/why-publish-open-data/">releasing open data themselves</a>, one of the most important things Upstate governments can do to use data to enhance services and make better decisions is to leverage data that is available from counties and the state.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://data.ny.gov/">New York State open data portal</a> is an invaluable resource that contains important data sets that Upstate governments can use at no cost to enhance their operations and make smarter decisions. This post will explore <a href="https://dataupstate.org/2016/07/13/state-data-for-upstate-governments/">some of those data sets</a>, and some of the things that can be achieved with data from the State of New York.</p>
<p><span id="more-73"></span></p>
<p><strong>Identify Unpermitted Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Some Upstate governments have permit requirements for businesses that are unique to their jurisdiction. All of the major Upstate city governments (<a href="http://www.albanyny.org/Government/Departments/CityClerk/LicensesAndPermits.aspx">Albany</a>, <a href="http://www.syrgov.net/Documents_and_Forms.aspx#Finance">Syracuse</a>, <a href="http://www.binghamton-ny.gov/permits-and-licenses">Binghamton</a>, <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589935988">Rochester</a> and <a href="https://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/Home/City_Departments/EDPIS/Licenses/LicenseApplicationsCodeRequirements">Buffalo</a>) have their own set of requirements for businesses that want to operate within their jurisdiction. Ensuring compliance can be a tedious and time consuming task. Using data from the State of New York can be an easy and efficient way to identify businesses that are not permitted within your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Does your government require permits for auto service facilities (like <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589935988">Rochester</a> does)? Cross check against the State DMV&#8217;s <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Facilities-Licensed-by-the-Department-of-Motor-Veh/nhjr-rpi2">list of licensed facilities</a>.</p>
<p>Does your government require a license for retail food stores (like <a href="https://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/Home/City_Departments/EDPIS/Licenses/LicenseApplicationsCodeRequirements">Buffalo</a> does)? Check your local licensee list against the State Department of Agriculture and Market&#8217;s list of <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Retail-Food-Stores/9a8c-vfzj">licensed food retailers</a>.</p>
<p>This is a simple, effective, low cost way to determine if local businesses that have complied with state requirements have obtained necessary permits or licenses from local governments.</p>
<p><strong>Identify Zoning Violations</strong></p>
<p>Businesses operating without local permits or licenses may also be in violation of local zoning ordinances, that determine where businesses may locate.</p>
<p>Almost all of the data available from the State &#8216;s open data portal comes with geospatial information, which makes it easy to put on a map and compare to zoning districts. Using zoning data from <a href="http://broomegis.co.broome.ny.us/website/gisweb/portal.htm?tab=data">Broome County</a>, we can examine different business types in the City of Binghamton to determine if any are potentially operating in areas not zoned for commercial activity.</p>
<p>The map below shows areas zoned residential in the <a href="http://www.binghamton-ny.gov/">City of Binghamton</a>, and displays the location of various business types using data from the State&#8217;s open data portal.</p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.carto.com/viz/899d7a18-3718-11e6-9d99-0e5db1731f59/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Most of the commercial activity displayed using the state data appears in areas that are not zoned residential, but there are some cases that warrant further scrutiny &#8211; particularly of food service establishments. In addition, there are a number of other business types that can be examined to ensure that commercial activity is occurring only in areas properly zoned for it.</p>
<p><strong>Optimize Snow Plow Routes</strong></p>
<p>The challenge of keeping roads plowed during Upstate winters  is significant. And every year, government officials Upstate <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2015/02/are_syracuse_side_streets_getting_plowed_quickly_enough.html">face scrutiny</a> about whether the plows are running quickly (and fairly) enough.</p>
<p>Every snowstorm is different, but using data to ensure that critical facilities and infrastructure are cleared as quickly as possible can be an effective way to respond to such scrutiny &#8211; and to make the process more transparent for citizens. Using state data to ensure that vital locations like <a href="https://511ny.org/developers/resources">bus stops</a>, nursing homes and <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Child-Care-Regulated-Programs/cb42-qumz">child care centers</a> are cleared efficiently can go a long way toward helping foster trust in local services and help citizens carry on with work and play after a big storm.</p>
<p><strong>Generate Economic Indicators</strong></p>
<p>Using state data can help local officials get a better picture of not only where economic and business activity is occurring in their jurisdiction, but also how much it changes over time. This can be a huge benefit for not only local economic development efforts, but can also be used to inform local planning changes and infrastructure investments.</p>
<p>It can also help local officials determine if there are areas in their jurisdictions that are <a href="http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/usda-defines-food-deserts">underserved by certain types of businesses</a>, or areas where certain types of businesses are concentrated in low-income neighborhoods. For example, the map below shows the location of retail establishments that sell alcohol in Syracuse and highlights census tracts that have high levels of poverty.</p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.carto.com/viz/35653b26-938e-11e5-bac3-0e3ff518bd15/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The New York State open data portal &#8211; and <a href="https://511ny.org/developers/resources">other state-level data resources</a> &#8211; make hugely valuable data for local governments availalbe for free and in easy to use formats.</p>
<p>Governments in Upstate New York that want to enhance their services and make more informed decisions should  leverage this important resource.</p>
