										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting a speeding ticket in the State of New York can be a traumatic &#8211; and expensive &#8211; experience.</p>
<p>Drivers convicted of speeding often face <a href="http://www.dmv.org/ny-new-york/traffic-ticket-fines-and-penalties.php">penalties and fines</a>, and repeated or excessive offenses can result in the loss of a license. But in some places in New York State, drivers issued a speeding ticket may see a very different outcome than one would typically expect: a smaller fine, the avoidance of long-term penalties, and &#8211; oddly enough &#8211; additional money in local government coffers.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote a post detailing some data science techniques that <a href="https://civic.io/2015/02/03/command-line-data-science/">used a data set from the State of New York</a> on traffic violations. This is an <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Four-Year-Window/q4hy-kbtf">incredibly rich data set</a> and it&#8217;s awesome that the state makes this available as open data. However, the issuance of traffic tickets only tells part of a larger story &#8211; since the release of this initial data set, the state has now released data on <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">traffic ticket convictions</a>. Comparing both of these data sets allows us to see the full picture of what happens when a traffic ticket is issued in the State of New York, from issuance all the way through to adjudication.</p>
<p>An examination of these data sets show that &#8211; in certain areas of the state &#8211; tickets issued for speeding are much more likely to be negotiated down to a lessor offense that allows drivers to avoid a penalty from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and actually provides a backdoor benefit for local governments.</p>
<p><span id="more-147"></span></p>
<p><strong>A Lesser Offense </strong></p>
<p>There is a longstanding practice in New York State that allows local courts where traffic violations are adjudicated to accept a plea bargain for a lessor offense from some drivers that are issued tickets for speeding. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any hard and fast set of rules governing this behavior, but what I have found through research suggests that at the judge or prosecutor&#8217;s discretion motorists that don&#8217;t have prior speeding violations and/or weren&#8217;t speeding excessively may be allowed to plead down to a non-moving violation. These lessor offenses typically aren&#8217;t reported to DMV so they don&#8217;t result in <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/about-nys-driver-point-system">points against a driver&#8217;s license</a>. The fines owed for these non-moving violations may be lower than the fines for speeding, and because of the nature of the offense all of the fine revenue goes to the local jurisdiction, not the state.</p>
<p>This would seem to create a perverse incentive for local jurisdictions to allow drivers to plead down speeding tickets, and some proposals have been made to <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20130126/cityandregion/130129321/1010">alter the practice</a>. Funding municipal operations through fines and penalties has led to <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-ferguson-missouri-court-fines-budget.html">serious issues in other parts of the country</a>, and we should be concerned that this practice may result in an uneven (and unfair) application of the law. Whether or not a motorist should be allowed to plead down to a lesser offense should be based on factors other than whether the local jurisdiction wants or needs the revenue to fund their operations.</p>
<p>Now &#8211; thanks to the State of New York&#8217;s open data efforts &#8211; we have data that can be used to determine how widespread this practice is, and make some recommendations for what policy makers should do going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at the Data</strong></p>
<p>Once the data from the state&#8217;s portal is loaded into a local <acronym title="Relational Database management System">RDBMS</acronym> (more on this in the technical notes below), we can run queries against it. For the purposes of this analysis, we wanted to determine the <em>conviction rate</em> for speeding tickets for each local court in the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">convictions data set</a>. To do this, we need to count up the number of tickets issued for speeding violations that get assigned to each local court and compare it the number of convictions for speeding offenses for that court. In other words:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>speeding convictions / speeding tickets issues = conviction rate</strong></p>
<p>In running queries against the data, it probably makes sense to limit our analysis to jurisdictions where a non-trivial number of speeding tickets are issued. If pleading down tickets to lesser offenses creates an unwanted incentive for local officials, this is probably more likely to occur in places the local revenue generated from this practice is more significant.</p>
<p>So, if we restrict our analysis to jurisdictions where 10,000 or more speeding tickets were issued over the four year period covered by the state&#8217;s data, we get the following.</p>

<p>At the top of the list &#8211; meaning places that have the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">lowest</span> conviction rates for speeding tickets issued &#8211; we see the City of Tonawanda (not to be confused with the Town of Tonawanda, which is also on the list)  located in Western New York near Buffalo. The rate of conviction on speeding tickets in the City of Tonawanda is about 7.5%. The Town of Hamburg and the Town of Amherst &#8211; which also have very low conviction rates for speeding tickets &#8211; are also in Western NY.</p>
<p>Overall, the list includes areas with major highways and significant traffic levels &#8211; Clarkstown, Yonkers, Suffolk and Southampton are all downstate and Long Island, and Troy and Guilderland are in the Capital Region &#8211; which are places where we would expect to see lots of traffic tickets issued. If we look at how the practice of pleading down traffic violations plays out in terms of local revenue, we can see that it may provide significant support for some jurisdictions. In the <a href="http://www.ci.tonawanda.ny.us/treasurer/budget_2015_and_supporting_documentation.pdf">City of Tanowanda</a>, fine revenue represents about $475,000 annually &#8211; about 6.5% of total city revenue (excluding state aid). Not the largest revenue source by any stretch, but certainly enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the list &#8211; meaning places that have the highest rates of convictions for speeding tickets are the various <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/find-tvb-office-locations">Traffic Violation Bureaus</a>. These are run by the state DMV, so there is no incentive to plead down speeding tickets to lesser offenses and generate local revenue. In fact, I don&#8217;t think plea bargains are allowed at these facilities. This means that for some areas &#8211; like Western NY &#8211; drivers may see the final adjudication of their speeding ticket handled very differently depending on where it is issued (or, more accurately, depending on the court it is assigned to).</p>
<p>Around the City of Buffalo there are a number of jurisdictions &#8211; Tonawanda, Amherst, Hamburg, Cheektowanga &#8211; that have very low conviction rates for speeding tickets. But within the City of Buffalo (where speeding tickets are adjudicated by the Traffic Violation Bureau) the conviction rates are much higher.</p>
<p><strong>Where Do We Go From Here?</strong></p>
<p>The current situation, where drivers issued speeding tickets are allowed to plead down to lesser offenses and generate local revenue, seems far from ideal for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>The practice of supporting municipal operations through penalty and fine revenue can create <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/doj-warns-local-courts-in-u-s-about-use-of/article_b9b8afd6-74e1-5303-ae3d-c3492514714e.html">perverse incentives</a> and undermine people&#8217;s confidence in the impartiality of government officials. Because there are no hard and fast rules governing how different jurisdictions allow drivers to plead to lesser offenses, there is no way to make sure that this opportunity is being evenly applied. Do men and women plead at the same rate? Do minorities plead at the same rate as whites? The data currently available don&#8217;t allow us to evaluate these questions, but the quasi-formal nature of the practice should raise concerns.</p>
<p>Moreover, the incentive created by this practice should be particularly concerning from a traffic safety perspective. The penalties and fines established for speeding are put in place for a reason &#8211; <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.21798/abstract">they work</a>, by reducing the incidence of fatal accidents and loss of life. Permitting speeders a chance to plea to a lesser offense allows potentially dangerous drivers to remain on the road with little consequence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all state policy makers see it this way. In Buffalo &#8211; where this analysis shows the imbalance between conviction rates is stark &#8211; state legislators have in recent years <a href="http://wivb.com/2014/06/20/coming-soon-to-buffalo-talking-down-traffic-tickets/">moved to allow speeders in the city to plead to a lesser offense</a>, the same opportunity afforded ticketed drivers in surrounding towns and villages.</p>
<p>This is a move in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Local governments &#8211; particularly in Upstate New York &#8211; are strapped financially, burdened by crumbling infrastructure and face a host of challenges in funding their operations. But we should not allow the practice of pleading down speeding tickets to be used as a way to provide a financial crutch to New York&#8217;s ailing local governments. Policy makers should eliminate this practice altogether.</p>
<p>Supporting local governments shouldn&#8217;t require making our highways and roadways less safe.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Notes: Here&#8217;s How I Obtained and Used the Data</strong></p>
<p>The logic for calculating conviction rates is contained in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-conviction-rate-sql">couple of stored procedures</a> &#8211; one to determine the conviction rate for speeding tickets for a given year, and the other to calculate it over the four year period that both data sets cover (this is the one used to generate the table shown above). This is obviously not to most elegant or efficient SQL, but for the purposes of this analysis it will do the job.</p>
<p>All of the data used in this analysis is available from the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/">State of New York&#8217;s open data portal</a> and cover the period from 2011 &#8211; 2014. Specifically, I make use of the traffic ticket data set <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Four-Year-Window/q4hy-kbtf">here</a>, and the traffic ticket conviction data set <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">here</a>. Since I want to combine data from both sets, I opted to download both and load them into a local RDBMS so I could run <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> queries on them.</p>
<p>The traffic ticket data set is rather large &#8211; over 14 million rows. It contains one record for each ticket issued along with descriptive information about the violation, when it was issued and the court it was assigned to for adjudication. For the purposes of this analysis, we are interested in tickets issued for speeding, so we confine our queries to a subset of all tickets with the set of descriptions <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-violation-descriptions-md">listed here</a>. This list was generated by selecting violation descriptions with the word <code>SPEED</code> in them &#8211; a little simplistic but not a bad way to start. A few of the ticket categories seem out of place &#8211; like <code>UNLAWFUL SPEEDOMETER</code> and <code>VEH WITH PERFORMANCE SPEED LESS THAN 55 MPH REG-9</code> &#8211; so for now, we&#8217;ll drop them from our analysis.</p>
<p>The conviction data set contains aggregate counts of convictions for specific violation types (in this analysis, I focused on <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-conviction-descriptions-md">this set</a>). Since these are aggregate counts, we can&#8217;t tie specific tickets to an outcome in a local court (at least not with these data sets). However, we can look at each court and sum up the types of convictions that occur for a given time period. Since the ticket data set includes information on the court each ticket was assigned to, we can create a view of how many tickets issued for speeding in the State of New York were plead down to lesser offenses and in which jurisdictions the practice is more prevalent.</p>
<p>I should note that the conviction data set needed a bit of tweaking before I could conduct this analysis. The format for the <code>Court_Name</code> field was slightly different from the ticket data set, and this was the field I wanted to use to match ticket counts to conviction counts. Using <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>, I was able to modify this data set and add a new column named <code>Standard_Court_Name</code> that used the same naming convention as the ticket data set. As such, the table structure for this data set in my local database <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-data-load-sql">differs slightly</a> from the structure of the data available on the NYS data portal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common impediments governments face in making better use of their data &#8211; and releasing it to the public &#8211; is data quality.</p>
<p>Since much of the data that municipal governments maintain and use relates to a specific location, ensuring that address data is complete and accurate can make this data much easier to use, and much more valuable. There are some easy techniques that government can utilize to better ensure that address information &#8211; whether submitted by citizens themselves or collected in other ways &#8211; is as complete and accurate as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, once collected, taking steps to standardize address information can make it much easier to share within municipal government, as well as with other governments and external data users.</p>
<p><span id="more-70"></span></p>
<p><strong>Collecting Good Data</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to enhance data quality is to make it easy for citizens to submit good information in the first place. Every form that citizens use to interact with your jurisdiction &#8211; to obtain a permit or license, to submit a service request, etc. &#8211; is a chance to capture accurate information from them.</p>
<p>Web-based form submissions are a common way for most citizens to interact with their local government, and &#8211; properly designed &#8211; can help ensure your government gets the most accurate information possible directly from citizens. An effective way of ensuring that accurate address information gets collected when citizens or businesses submit a web form is to use an <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-addressform">address autocomplete service</a>.</p>
<p>This simple web service is incorporated into web-based forms and assists users in entering valid addresses in a form that is optimized for internal use.  An example of how an autocomplete service can make address entry easier for citizens and more accurate for government can be seen below.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mheadd/address-autocomplete/gh-pages/autocomplete.gif" width="1464" height="702" /></p>
<p>Creating an autocomplete service is straightforward and low in cost &#8211; data on street names and subdivision names is available from a variety of sources at no charge. Both the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a> and the <a href="http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/inventories/details.cfm?DSID=921">NYS GIS Clearinghouse</a> make this data available for any Upstate government to use.</p>
<p><strong>Standardizing Existing Data</strong></p>
<p>If your jurisdiction collects address data on forms or applications, chances are that this data exists in a variety of formats across different agencies or departments. The quality of this address data may vary greatly depending on how it was collected and how it is maintained.</p>
<p>One way to make this data more usable and more valuable is to standardize it across all departments, and to ensure that it is properly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding">geocoded</a>. This allows users to view a much richer (and more complete) history for a specific property by enabling them to combine data from across different departments &#8211; and even combine it with data from different government entities.</p>
<p>It can also benefit efforts that are focused on understanding or optimizing how things work on a city or county-wide scale. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a relationship between the location of specific licensed businesses &#8211; or type of businesses &#8211; and calls to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1">311</a> (or 911)?</li>
<li>Are permits or licenses from one department being issued to properties with outstanding violations or complaints from another department?</li>
<li>Are local businesses in compliance with state or county permitting requirements but out of compliance with local requirements?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the many questions that governments should consider as they work to improve the level of service they are providing. Each of these questions requires address data to be standardized across multiple local agencies.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways standardize address data, and your jurisdiction may have access to a tool or utility that can compare raw addresses submitted by a citizen on a form or application to an authoritative source. The NYS GIS Clearinghouse provides <a href="http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/inventories/details.cfm?DSID=1278">a public geocoder services</a> that can be used to standardize addresses data and to provide geospatial information. This service uses authoritative data collected from each county &#8211; and while it is continually being refined and enhanced, this is a powerful resource for any local government that wants to enhance its existing data by standardizing addresses and adding geospatial data. The U.S. Census Bureau provides <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/geocoder.html">a similar service</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally, once an address has been standardized it can be assigned a unique identifier that can be used across departments that refer to the same piece of property when discussing services delivered by different departments.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Data</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common impediments to sharing data both inside governments and with outside users is data quality. Even if your internal government departments &#8211; and external data users &#8211; have access to your data, they may face challenges in using it efficiently because of a non-standard address format.</p>
<p>Having an internal dialog about address standardization can be beneficial in a much deeper way for local governments as well. These conversations encourage departments to look at property data collectively, which can help surface issues with different departments maintaining their own customized information about a property.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t all that uncommon, as different departments may view the same parcel of land through the lens of their own specific service or activity.  The tax assessors office, water department, zoning office and other agencies may all have a different view of a parcel or address and maintain slightly different information about it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goals of a local government and the people it serves are better realized when these different views are unified &#8211; encouraging more meaningful data sharing both inside and outside of government.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with <a href="https://dataupstate.org/2016/06/22/why-publish-open-data/">releasing open data themselves</a>, one of the most important things Upstate governments can do to use data to enhance services and make better decisions is to leverage data that is available from counties and the state.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://data.ny.gov/">New York State open data portal</a> is an invaluable resource that contains important data sets that Upstate governments can use at no cost to enhance their operations and make smarter decisions. This post will explore <a href="https://dataupstate.org/2016/07/13/state-data-for-upstate-governments/">some of those data sets</a>, and some of the things that can be achieved with data from the State of New York.</p>
<p><span id="more-73"></span></p>
<p><strong>Identify Unpermitted Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Some Upstate governments have permit requirements for businesses that are unique to their jurisdiction. All of the major Upstate city governments (<a href="http://www.albanyny.org/Government/Departments/CityClerk/LicensesAndPermits.aspx">Albany</a>, <a href="http://www.syrgov.net/Documents_and_Forms.aspx#Finance">Syracuse</a>, <a href="http://www.binghamton-ny.gov/permits-and-licenses">Binghamton</a>, <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589935988">Rochester</a> and <a href="https://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/Home/City_Departments/EDPIS/Licenses/LicenseApplicationsCodeRequirements">Buffalo</a>) have their own set of requirements for businesses that want to operate within their jurisdiction. Ensuring compliance can be a tedious and time consuming task. Using data from the State of New York can be an easy and efficient way to identify businesses that are not permitted within your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Does your government require permits for auto service facilities (like <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589935988">Rochester</a> does)? Cross check against the State DMV&#8217;s <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Facilities-Licensed-by-the-Department-of-Motor-Veh/nhjr-rpi2">list of licensed facilities</a>.</p>
<p>Does your government require a license for retail food stores (like <a href="https://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/Home/City_Departments/EDPIS/Licenses/LicenseApplicationsCodeRequirements">Buffalo</a> does)? Check your local licensee list against the State Department of Agriculture and Market&#8217;s list of <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Retail-Food-Stores/9a8c-vfzj">licensed food retailers</a>.</p>
<p>This is a simple, effective, low cost way to determine if local businesses that have complied with state requirements have obtained necessary permits or licenses from local governments.</p>
<p><strong>Identify Zoning Violations</strong></p>
<p>Businesses operating without local permits or licenses may also be in violation of local zoning ordinances, that determine where businesses may locate.</p>
<p>Almost all of the data available from the State &#8216;s open data portal comes with geospatial information, which makes it easy to put on a map and compare to zoning districts. Using zoning data from <a href="http://broomegis.co.broome.ny.us/website/gisweb/portal.htm?tab=data">Broome County</a>, we can examine different business types in the City of Binghamton to determine if any are potentially operating in areas not zoned for commercial activity.</p>
<p>The map below shows areas zoned residential in the <a href="http://www.binghamton-ny.gov/">City of Binghamton</a>, and displays the location of various business types using data from the State&#8217;s open data portal.</p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.carto.com/viz/899d7a18-3718-11e6-9d99-0e5db1731f59/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Most of the commercial activity displayed using the state data appears in areas that are not zoned residential, but there are some cases that warrant further scrutiny &#8211; particularly of food service establishments. In addition, there are a number of other business types that can be examined to ensure that commercial activity is occurring only in areas properly zoned for it.</p>
<p><strong>Optimize Snow Plow Routes</strong></p>
<p>The challenge of keeping roads plowed during Upstate winters  is significant. And every year, government officials Upstate <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2015/02/are_syracuse_side_streets_getting_plowed_quickly_enough.html">face scrutiny</a> about whether the plows are running quickly (and fairly) enough.</p>
<p>Every snowstorm is different, but using data to ensure that critical facilities and infrastructure are cleared as quickly as possible can be an effective way to respond to such scrutiny &#8211; and to make the process more transparent for citizens. Using state data to ensure that vital locations like <a href="https://511ny.org/developers/resources">bus stops</a>, nursing homes and <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Child-Care-Regulated-Programs/cb42-qumz">child care centers</a> are cleared efficiently can go a long way toward helping foster trust in local services and help citizens carry on with work and play after a big storm.</p>
<p><strong>Generate Economic Indicators</strong></p>
<p>Using state data can help local officials get a better picture of not only where economic and business activity is occurring in their jurisdiction, but also how much it changes over time. This can be a huge benefit for not only local economic development efforts, but can also be used to inform local planning changes and infrastructure investments.</p>
<p>It can also help local officials determine if there are areas in their jurisdictions that are <a href="http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/usda-defines-food-deserts">underserved by certain types of businesses</a>, or areas where certain types of businesses are concentrated in low-income neighborhoods. For example, the map below shows the location of retail establishments that sell alcohol in Syracuse and highlights census tracts that have high levels of poverty.</p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.carto.com/viz/35653b26-938e-11e5-bac3-0e3ff518bd15/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The New York State open data portal &#8211; and <a href="https://511ny.org/developers/resources">other state-level data resources</a> &#8211; make hugely valuable data for local governments availalbe for free and in easy to use formats.</p>
<p>Governments in Upstate New York that want to enhance their services and make more informed decisions should  leverage this important resource.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the excerpt for your very first post.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Open data, especially open government data, is a tremendous resource that is as yet largely untapped. Many individuals and organisations collect a broad range of different types of data in order to perform their tasks. Government is particularly significant in this respect, both because of the quantity and centrality of the data it collects, but also because most of that government data is public data by law, and therefore could be made open and made available for others to use. Why is that of interest?</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/">Open Data Handbook</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here are three reasons why publishing open data is important for local governments.</p>
<p><span id="more-6"></span></p>
<p>First, releasing data in open formats can dramatically reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to respond to open record / FOIL requests. For some government agencies, responding to these requests takes a non-trivial amount of time &#8211; particularly if they are not done in a coordinated fashion. I&#8217;ve witnessed agencies first hand manually work through open records requests for the exact same data over and over and over. This makes little sense, especially if the data has already been deemed public and suitable for release. Publishing frequently requested data in an open format allows people to self serve, and preserves internal staff time for more pressing needs.</p>
<p>In addition, if your city, county or state government only maintains data publicly as part of a web document or web site there is a good chance it is being <a href="https://morph.io/">scraped</a>. This tends to happen <strong>much</strong> more frequently than most government employees think. Scraping can cause undue burden on your IT infrastructure and undue stress on your IT staff that may be tasked with trying to troubleshoot issues caused by scrapers gone wild.</p>
<p>Second, when governments release data <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/apps/">it can foster the creation of new data uses, visualizations and software applications</a>. The potential for app development is greatly increased when there are standards that different governments can jointly adopt &#8211; some good examples are transit data (<a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference">GTFS</a>), citizen service requests (<a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>), building permits (<a href="http://permitdata.org/">BLDS</a>), and many <a href="http://labs.centerforgov.org/open-data/civic-data-standards/">others</a>.</p>
<p>Governments that release open data can leverage both their local developer community and the efforts of <a href="http://gov20.govfresh.com/civic-app-flu-shot-viral-open-government/">developers elsewhere</a> to bring useful apps to their citizens.</p>
<p>Finally, governments that share open data with outside consumers lay the foundation for a different, equally important, kind of sharing &#8211; sharing data across government agencies.</p>
<p>Cities are notoriously complex and stovepiped. For example, in Philadelphia the department that grants <a href="http://www.phila.gov/opa/Pages/default.aspx">property tax exemptions</a> is different than the one that collect <a href="http://www.phila.gov/revenue/Pages/default.aspx">property tax payments</a>. What if the city could condition the granting of exemptions on whether a property owner was current on their tax payments? Sounds simple, yet because of bureaucratic complexity it often is not.</p>
<p>In many places city and county government work closely together on a similar issue, or the responsibility for a service may reside with many local governments and be aggregated at the county or state level. In each of these cases, there are opportunities for governments to discover and easily use data from other governments for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Open data programs make data discoverable – they obviate the need for special relationships or political clout to obtain data. Anyone and everyone can see what data is available for use, so few resources are spent hunting around for data and connecting with data owners.</p>
<p>Open data programs make data more usable – they create incentives for governments to describe their data for people that are not domain experts, and to build services for easier and more efficient use of data.</p>
<p>Open data programs can help foster a “culture of sharing” within government. As noted in a <a href="https://dataupstate.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/annual_report_2013.pdf">2013 data analytics report</a> from the City of New York –<em> Aggregating cross-agency data is often first a political, legal, and cultural discussion</em>. Whether created by statute, executive order or some other vehicle, open data directives send a clear message to the bureaucracy that data sharing is not only beneficial, but expected.</p>
<p>Any government that wants to start down this road will quickly start to see the benefits.</p>
<p>They just have to <a href="http://opendata.guide/">get started</a>.</p>
