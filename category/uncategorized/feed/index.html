										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The City of Syracuse took another step in it&#8217;s open data evolution recently by launching an <a href="http://data.syrgov.net/">open data portal</a>, joining the City of Albany in the small but growing fraternity of Upstate cities with open data portal.</p>
<p>The new open data portal represents months of work by the city&#8217;s Chief Data Officer and <a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/datacuse">municipal innovation team</a>. There are a number of very useful and valuable data sets available on the site, particularly the newly released parcel data file with details on all 40,000+ properties in the city.</p>
<p>The launch of this site underscores Syracuse&#8217;s commitment to transparency and engagement, but it also shows that open data is not just for big cities. The City of Buffalo is also slated to <a href="http://buffalonews.com/2017/01/13/public-input-requested-buffalo-develops-plan-internet-access-city-data/">launch an open data portal soon</a>. Here&#8217;s hoping not only that we see more cities adopting open data, but that Upstate cities begin sharing new ideas and strategies for putting this data to work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">In late 2014, I had a chance to present on the main stage at the annual <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67AXJ_Y1VEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for America Summit</a> in San Francisco. To the surprise of very few people, I was there to talk about cities and data.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1040" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67AXJ_Y1VEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p class="graf graf--p">Earlier that year, I had <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/03/20/chief-data-officer-mark-headd-resign-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished up my term</a> as the first Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, one of the largest cities in the country. But my focus that day was not on big cities like Philadelphia — but rather on smaller cities that had not yet started down the road of leveraging data to spur innovation and inform better policy decisions.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In 2014, the delta between what large cities were doing with data and what small and mid-sized cities were doing <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was pretty stark</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Large cities had embraced open data almost universally and had put in place the policy or technology infrastructure necessary to implement open data or data analytics programs. Nineteen of the top 25 most populous cities had an open data portal or a data policy in place at the time. More than 70% of cities with populations over 500,000 had started down the road to leveraging data to make better decisions or change the way they interacted with residents.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In contrast, relatively few smaller cities had begun that work. Of the 256 incorporated places in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 (based on U.S. Census data), only 39 had adopted a data policy or had implemented an open data portal at that time.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But in the time since I gave that talk, much has changed — largely through the work being done as part of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Works Cities</a> initiative, which was launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2015 to work with mid-sized cities between 100,000 and 1 million in population, and is now partnering with over 75 cities across the country.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Beyond the Big City</h3>
<figure class="graf graf--figure">
<p><div style="width: 1568px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://dataupstate.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/90be3-1adxzemo2ryhliafblw28mq.jpeg?w=1558&#038;h=580" width="1558" height="580" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View of the City of Syracuse.

<p class="graf graf--p">Not long after I gave my talk at the Code for America Summit, I moved back to my hometown of Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Like other Upstate cities, Syracuse has its share of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/syracuses_poverty_rate_remains_among_worst_in_nation_census_finds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/miner_syracuse_water_main_breaks_down_18_percent_but_city_needs_federal_aid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenges</a>, and seems to live perpetually in the shadow of its gigantic Downstate neighbor — New York City — when it comes to technology and innovation. But the work that Syracuse has done over the past few years to adopt new approaches to sharing and using data are impressive and can serve as a model not only for other Upstate cities, but for mid-sized cities across the United States.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Syracuse has fostered several key strategic relationships that have accelerated its adoption of data-driven innovation. Chief among them is the city’s <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/whatworkscities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participation</a> in What Works Cities, through which it has been receiving expert technical assistance in the areas of open data and performance analytics from two of the initiative’s partners, the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://govex.jhu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Government Excellence</a> at Johns Hopkins University and the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunlight Foundation</a>. This tops an impressive resume of other partnerships that the city has leveraged to move the needle on data-driven innovation.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The city has also participated in the Bloomberg Philanthropies <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innovation Teams</a> (or i-teams) program, which fostered the creation of a dedicated group within municipal government to focus on persistent challenges facing the city. One of the first areas of focus for this team was the significant infrastructure issues that have saddled the city for decades. The Syracuse i-team collaborated with the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Science for Social Good</a> project at the University of Chicago to develop a predictive analytic model to help focus limited city resources on the most urgent infrastructure problems. Not only is the city putting the fruits of this partnership to work itself, it is sharing them with other cities using the open source software platform <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/dssg/syracuse_public" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One of the key strategies in Syracuse’s successful adoption of a data and innovation program has been its willingness to import good ideas from other cities and adapt them to its own needs. The city just finished a collaboration with Code for America, which resulted in the development of a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://business.syrgov.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new business registration portal </a>that was a top priority of Mayor Stephanie Miner. Because the project leveraged work that had already been done in Long Beach, California, Syracuse could implement a similar solution faster and with less risk than if it had undertaken the work without following a prior example.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Earlier this year, Syracuse <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/syracuse_fire_department_takes_data-driven_approach_to_getting_smoke_detectors_i.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> a new program to use data to target at-risk properties in the city for distribution of free smoke detectors from the Syracuse Fire Department. This initiative leveraged a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://labs.enigma.io/smoke-signals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data model</a> developed originally for the City of New Orleans and that was in use in a number of other cities across the country. By adapting an idea already at work in other cities, Syracuse could piggyback on the hard work that had already been done and bring results to city residents more efficiently.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">While importing ideas directly from other cities can provide mid-sized cities like Syracuse with a number of advantages, not all ideas translate directly from big cities to smaller ones.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, New York City benefits from the ability to rally its sizable technology community around issues with a civic impact through programs like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.bigapps.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYC Big Apps</a>. Other big cities have also used events like this to marshal their private and nonprofit technology communities around issues with citywide impact. But for other cities, with smaller, less centralized technology communities, sponsoring a stand-alone civic technology event can be a daunting challenge.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Syracuse’s approach of adapting this big-city idea to work on a smaller stage is a great example for other cities to follow. Instead of hosting its own city-sponsored civic tech events, the city has opted instead to tap into an existing network of technologists in the Central New York region. For the past few years, the city had been quietly interested in a biannual event called <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://hackupstate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hack Upstate</a>, held in Downtown Syracuse in the spring and fall of each year. The event consistently attracts a large number of software developers and technologists from across Upstate New York.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In late 2016, the city partnered with Hack Upstate to unveil a new challenge aimed at analyzing data on road conditions in Syracuse. Participants in Hack Upstate could compete for an additional award as part of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://cityofsyracuse.github.io/RoadsChallenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syracuse Road Data Challenge</a>, and many participants opted to use the road data that the city made available to participants to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://medium.com/@hackupstate/hack-upstate-viii-the-results-are-in-4c4f4fb1abf#.kn92n0cc3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">develop new solutions</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Looking at the work that a city like Syracuse has done over the past few years provides some important lessons for how small and mid-sized cities (and even larger cities) can more fully embrace data as a strategic asset and foster innovation.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Leverage a Network</h3>
<figure class="graf graf--figure">
<p><div style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://dataupstate.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/46db9-1hh6cojlwcw2frcdokkri6g.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=480" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Syracuse Chief Data Officer Sam Edelstein, Mayor Stephanie Minor, and Dean of the Syracuse University School of Information Studies Elizabeth Liddy launch the Syracuse Roads Challenge.</p></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"></figcaption></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">While large cities may have some advantages over smaller cities in their ability to drive innovation, one disadvantage they face is that their network of peer cities is relatively small. There are only so many cities the size of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami — only 10 cities in the U.S have populations over 1 million. In contrast, there are about 250 cities in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Programs like What Works Cities provide small and mid-sized cities with a valuable opportunity to connect and collaborate with their peers, including an upcoming second annual <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summit</a> in New York City in which hundreds of mayors, city leaders and frontline practitioners will gather to learn from experts and exchange ideas. And a new certification program being rolled out by What Works Cities will provide an opportunity for even more cities to participate in the initiative and join its growing network; any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more will be welcome to apply.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">As cities like Syracuse have demonstrated, being able to leverage ideas from peers is a key component of driving innovation and adopting data-driven strategies.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Ruthless Adaptation of Ideas</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The real power of open source software (the idea that the code that makes up software solutions should be freely available to all) and open data is that it enables one to build on the work of others — to adapt someone else’s work to solve your own problem. The principles behind open source and open data allow smaller cities to borrow ideas from other places and to punch above their weight on innovation.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Cities like Syracuse are great at ruthlessly adapting ideas that are at work in other places to solve their own local problems and improve the ways they provide services to residents. But knowing where to look to find good ideas can often be a challenge; smaller cities need to know which cities are leading the way in using data to allocate scarce resources more efficiently or inform new policy choices.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">What Works Cities promises to address this challenge through its new certification program, which establishes a comprehensive standard for evaluating the data and evidence work being done in cities. This new standard will help to identify and nationally recognize the work of cities that are excelling in how they use data to transform what they do and allow other cities to emulate their efforts by borrowing their best ideas.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is the way that small and mid-sized cities will drive innovation and the adoption of data-driven governance in the years ahead.</p>
